/**
 * API Resource
 * <p>
 * The API Resource provides a high-level description of an exposed API.
 * You can find more information, such as the API resource definitions, in the links in the table below.
 * 
 * An API Resource bundles multiple endpoints and resources together.
 * They share the same API namespace and lifecycle (API major version).
 * However, the exact granularity of this is up to the implementer of the API.
 * As a consequence, an API resource MUST NOT bundle together endpoints from different API versions or namespaces.
 * 
 * A common practice is to bundle endpoints that are based on the same domain or Business Object.
 * 
 * Please note that APIs can be described, but still be [`disabled`](#api-resource_disabled).
 * 
 * If the API is not created or owned by the user of the system or by third parties (like partners), it MUST be assigned to dedicated [Packages](#package) that state this the ownership via the `vendor` property.
 *
