/**
 * Consumption Bundle
 * <p>
 * A [**Consumption Bundle**](../concepts/grouping-and-bundling#consumption-bundle) groups APIs and Events together that can be consumed with the credentials and auth mechanism.
 * Ideally it also includes instructions and details how to request access and credentials for resources.
 * 
 * For more documentation and guidance how to correctly this correctly, see [Consumption Bundle details](../concepts/grouping-and-bundling#consumption-bundle).
 * 
 * A Consumption Bundle SHOULD have at least one association with a resource (0..n). Avoid empty Consumption Bundles.
 * A Consumption Bundle MUST NOT contain APIs and Events that are NOT defined in the ORD document(s) returned
 * by the system instance that defines the Consumption Bundle.
 * 
 * Please note that some ORD consumer use cases MAY depend on Consumption Bundle assignments to work with the resources.
 * 
 * To learn more about the concept, see [Consumption Bundle](../concepts/grouping-and-bundling#consumption-bundle).
