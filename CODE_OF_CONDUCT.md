# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as maintainers, contributors, and community members of the **Release Creator and Changelog Updater** project pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other contributors and users.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project as a whole.
- Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to issues, pull requests, code reviews, and social media channels directly associated with the project. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at [ospo@sap.com](mailto:ospo@sap.com) (SAP Open Source Program Office). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
